Evaluate the following aspects:
1. **Grammar and Spelling** – Any mechanical or typographic errors.
2. **Voice** – Strong preference for active over passive voice.
3. **Action Verbs** – Powerful, varied verbs that lead each bullet with impact.
4. **Clarity & Conciseness** – No filler, fluff, or verbosity.
5. **Tone & Professionalism** – High signal, confident tone without arrogance or jargon.
6. **Tense & Formatting Consistency** – Consistent verb tense and punctuation.
