- **Professional** – Polished, mature, and appropriate for senior-level or executive roles.
- **Engaging** – Captures interest without being overly casual or rigid.
- **Confident but Humble** – Shows competence and leadership without arrogance.
- **Appropriately Enthusiastic** – Expresses interest in the role or company in a sincere, job-relevant way (not vague excitement or flattery).

- Arrogance or overconfidence not supported by the resume
