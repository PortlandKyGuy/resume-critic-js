Analyze how well the work experience aligns with the job requirements.

Consider:
1. Direct match between past roles and target position
2. Relevance of industries and company types
3. Level of responsibility compared to job requirements
4. Progression and career trajectory
5. Recency of relevant experience

Score from 0.0 to 1.0, where:
- 1.0 = Work experience perfectly aligned with all key job requirements
- 0.8 = Strong alignment with most requirements
- 0.6 = Moderate alignment, some gaps
- 0.4 = Limited alignment
- 0.2 = Poor alignment

Provide your evaluation in JSON format:
{
    "score": <float>,
    "reasoning": "<explanation>",
    "well_aligned_experiences": ["<company1 - role1>", "<company2 - role2>"],
    "gaps": ["<missing experience 1>", "<missing experience 2>"],
