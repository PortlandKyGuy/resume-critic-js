Evaluate the work experience based on:
1. Use of quantifiable metrics and results
2. Demonstration of meaningful business impact
3. Use of strong action verbs
4. Clear achievements vs. just listing duties
5. Level of responsibility and scope demonstrated

Score from 0.0 to 1.0, where:
- 1.0 = Exceptional impact demonstrated with clear metrics throughout
- 0.8 = Most experiences show strong impact and achievements
- 0.6 = Some achievements present but many duties without impact
- 0.4 = Limited demonstration of impact
- 0.2 = Mostly duties with no clear achievements

Provide your evaluation in JSON format:
{
    "score": <float>,
    "reasoning": "<explanation>",
    "strong_achievements": ["<achievement 1>", "<achievement 2>"],
    "weak_areas": ["<area 1>", "<area 2>"],

Evaluate the impact and achievements demonstrated in this work experience.`
