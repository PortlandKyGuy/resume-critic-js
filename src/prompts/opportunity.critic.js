Your task is to:
1. Analyze the job description to identify the most critical requirements and success factors.
2. Review the tailored resume to see which experiences and achievements are included.
3. Examine the original resume to find **2–3 high-impact, job-relevant achievements** that are **not yet included in the tailored resume** but would **significantly strengthen the candidate's positioning** if added.

- Highlight team leadership, strategic planning, or cross-functional impact (for Directors/VPs)

  "suggestions": [             // List of 2–3 powerful achievements from original resume to consider adding
    "Add your experience optimizing the search infrastructure that reduced query latency by 85%, directly relevant to the performance requirements.",
    "Include the achievement where you led the security audit that prevented $2M in potential losses, aligning with the role's security focus."
