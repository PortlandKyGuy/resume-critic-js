# Astraeus Setup - Resume Evaluation API

## Task Summary
Successfully configured a comprehensive AI agent team for the Resume Evaluation API project based on the architecture document at `./docs/api-architecture.md`.

## What Was Created

### 1. Directory Structure
- `.claude/agents/` - Agent definition files
- `.aidevs/tasks/` - Task documentation
- `reports/` - Agent report outputs
- `docs/` - Documentation and synthesis reports
- `output/` - Generated outputs

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Enhanced `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific details and orchestration policy
- Created `.claude/sub_agents_memory.md` for shared agent knowledge
- Created `.claude/AGENT_MANIFEST.md` documenting all agents

### 3. Specialized Agents (11 Total)

#### Core Development Team
- **functional-programming-expert**: Ramda and functional patterns specialist
- **api-design-specialist**: RESTful API and Express.js expert
- **system-architecture-expert**: Scalability and system design authority

#### Quality Assurance Team
- **test-engineer**: Jest and TDD specialist
- **code-reviewer-critic**: Code quality auditor
- **security-auditor-critic**: Security vulnerability assessor

#### Domain Specialists
- **llm-integration-specialist**: Multi-provider LLM integration expert
- **prompt-engineering-expert**: Prompt optimization specialist
- **nodejs-performance-optimizer**: Performance and scalability expert

#### Planning & Coordination
- **implementation-planner**: Task breakdown and roadmap creator
- **report-synthesizer**: Multi-agent report consolidator and arbiter

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Opus for complex reasoning tasks (architecture, prompt engineering, synthesis)
   - Sonnet for focused implementation and review tasks
   
2. **Tool Assignment**:
   - Minimal tools following principle of least privilege
   - No direct file modification for sub-agents (advisory only)
   - Memory tool included for persistent knowledge sharing

3. **Functional Focus**:
   - All agents understand functional programming principles
   - Emphasis on immutability and pure functions
   - Batch processing optimization for LLM calls

## Next Steps

1. **Test Agent Invocation**: Try invoking agents for specific tasks
2. **Implement Core Features**: Use agents to plan and implement the API
3. **Establish Patterns**: Document successful agent usage patterns
4. **Iterate**: Refine agent prompts based on actual usage

## Usage Example

```
"I need to implement the batch evaluation pipeline for processing multiple critics"

→ Invoke functional-programming-expert for pipeline design
→ Invoke llm-integration-specialist for batch processing  
→ Invoke code-reviewer-critic for quality review
→ Invoke report-synthesizer to consolidate recommendations
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ All core agent archetypes covered
- ✅ Project-specific expertise captured
- ✅ Clear invocation triggers defined
- ✅ R.A.C.R.S. workflow embedded
- ✅ Shared memory system established

The AI agent team is now ready to support the development of the Resume Evaluation API with specialized expertise in functional programming, API design, and LLM integration.
